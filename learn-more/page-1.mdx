## Understanding the Architecture

Our product is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed to handle high-volume workloads while maintaining performance and reliability. This page explains the core architectural components and how they work together.

### System Components

The system consists of several key components:

1. **Client SDK** - The interface that your application uses to communicate with our services
2. **API Gateway** - Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
3. **Processing Engine** - The core component that processes your data
4. **Storage Layer** - Manages persistent data storage and retrieval
5. **Event System** - Coordinates asynchronous operations and notifications

### Data Flow

When you submit a request through our SDK:

1. The SDK prepares and validates your request
2. The request is sent to the API Gateway, which authenticates it
3. The Processing Engine receives the request and performs the required operations
4. Results are stored in the Storage Layer
5. The Event System triggers any configured notifications or webhooks
6. The response is returned to your application

## Performance Considerations

Understanding performance characteristics is crucial for building efficient applications with our product.

### Throughput and Latency

Our system is designed to handle:

- Up to 1,000 requests per second per account
- Average latency of 100-200ms for standard operations
- Up to 10GB of data processing per hour

To optimize performance:

- Batch related operations when possible
- Use compression for large data transfers
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Schedule bulk operations during off-peak hours

### Scaling Strategies

As your usage grows, consider these scaling strategies:

1. **Horizontal Scaling** - Distribute workloads across multiple instances
2. **Workload Partitioning** - Divide processing by data type or priority
3. **Asynchronous Processing** - Use background jobs for non-time-critical operations
4. **Resource Allocation** - Adjust resource limits based on workload patterns

## Security Best Practices

Security is a shared responsibility. While we secure our infrastructure, you should follow these best practices:

### API Key Management

- Store API keys securely, never in client-side code
- Use environment variables or a secure vault service
- Implement key rotation policies
- Create separate keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data before sending it to our API
- Implement proper access controls in your application
- Use TLS for all communications
- Regularly audit data access patterns

### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement the principle of least privilege
- Use OAuth 2.0 for user authentication when available
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting on your authentication endpoints
