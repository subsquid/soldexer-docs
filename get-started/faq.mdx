## General Questions

<Accordion title="What is Soldexer?">
  Soldexer is a high-throughput data service for accessing Solana's historical
  and real-time data. It processes 10MB+ per request with ~2-3 second latency,
  making it significantly faster than running your own node.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does it work?">
  Soldexer uses a decentralized network of 2,900+ worker nodes ([SQD
  Network](https://network.subsquid.io/dashboard)) to index and process Solana
  data. You make API calls to request specific data, and Soldexer returns it
  filtered and transformed according to your needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the connection between SQD and Soldexer?">
  [SQD Network](https://network.subsquid.io/dashboard) by [SQD](https://sqd.ai)
  provides the decentralized infrastructure that powers Soldexer. The network's
  2,900+ worker nodes ensure reliable data processing and transparent
  architecture.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the pricing model?">
  Pay-as-you-go based on actual usage. No upfront costs or commitments. This is
  significantly cheaper than running your own Geyser node (~$2k+/month) or using
  proprietary APIs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Soldexer compare to alternatives?">
  Here's how Soldexer compares to other solutions:

| Capability                 | Soldexer                                             | Geyser Node by Helius                                                             | Dune Analytics                                         | Other Solutions (QuickNode, Alchemy)                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed & Throughput         | ✅ Pull 10MB+ per request with ~2s latency           | ⚪ Real-time streaming, optimized for low latency but not bulk data requests      | ⚪ SQL queries with variable execution times           | ❌ Slower response times for high-volume queries; optimized for general-purpose RPC calls     |
| Transformation & Filtering | ✅ Built-in composable pipelines at source level     | ⚪ Requires custom plugin development for filtering                               | ⚪ SQL-based filtering, fixed to predefined SQL syntax | ❌ Limited filtering capabilities; requires external tools for advanced processing            |
| Historical Access          | ✅ Full archive (in progress)                        | ❌ Real-time only unless paired with external DB                                  | ✅ Extensive historical access                         | ⚪ Some archive data available but often slower and less efficient for large-scale queries    |
| Setup Complexity           | ✅ Ready out-of-the-box via SQD portal               | ⚪ Simplified with "Automatic Private Nodes" but needs DevOps for advanced setups | ✅ Easy to start, but limited flexibility              | ⚪ Easy setup via managed services but lacks customization options                            |
| Scalability                | ✅ Stateless, horizontally scalable                  | ⚪ Scalable with dedicated hardware but constrained by infrastructure costs       | ⚪ Platform-dependent scalability                      | ❌ Limited scalability for high-frequency workloads; performance tied to pricing tiers        |
| Architecture               | ✅ Decentralized (via SQD Network)                   | ⚪ Centralized validator or custom hosting                                        | ❌ Fully centralized platform                          | ❌ Fully centralized infrastructure reliant on proprietary APIs                               |
| Cost Efficiency            | ✅ Open infra/transparent pricing                    | ❌ High infra/validator maintenance                                               | ⚪ Free-to-query for basic use                         | ❌ Higher costs for enterprise-grade services; pay-as-you-go models can be expensive at scale |
| Developer Experience       | ✅ Built for engineers: streaming, filtering, piping | ❌ DIY heavy, plugin extensibility requires expertise                             | ⚪ SQL-only, no programming extensibility              | ⚪ Simplified APIs and dashboards but limited flexibility for custom solutions                |

## Technical Questions

<Accordion title="How do I use the API reference?">
  Check our API reference section for endpoint documentation, request/response
  formats, and example calls. Each endpoint includes usage examples and
  parameter descriptions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What programming languages and frameworks are supported?">
  Soldexer provides a REST API that works with any programming language or
  framework that can make HTTP requests. See our API section to learn more.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I filter data for specific accounts or instructions?">
  Use our granular filtering system to target specific accounts, instructions,
  programs, or transaction types. You can combine multiple filters in a single
  request for precise data retrieval.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there rate limits or usage quotas?">
  Yes, there are rate limits for public endpoints. TBD
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Soldexer with my existing data pipeline?">
  Yes. Soldexer's REST API and standardized data formats make it easy to
  integrate with existing ETL pipelines, databases, or analytics tools.
  [Pipes](/pipes/overview) are especially well-suited for being added to
  existing infrastructure. It's also not too difficult to build a custom
  client specifically for your system, see e.g. [this example by Cherry
  library](https://github.com/steelcake/cherry-core/blob/main/python/examples/solana.py).
