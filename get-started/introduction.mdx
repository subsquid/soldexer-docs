## Solana Data, Simplified

We're builders, just like you. We understand the challenges of working with Solana data—so we built Soldexer to make it faster, cleaner, and easier to work with.

## Why Soldexer?

Unlike running your own dedicated node (~$2k+/mo) or paying for proprietary APIs, Soldexer gives you scalable access, full filtering, and built-in transformations—at a fraction of the effort and cost.
