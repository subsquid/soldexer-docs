title: "Pipes vs Squid SDK"
description: "The two ways to consume the Soldexer API"
---

Aside from [pipes](/pipes/overview) you can also use [Squid SDK](/squid-sdk/intro) to access [Soldexer API](/api-reference/introduction). Here's the comparison:

|      | Pipes | Squid SDK |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Mental model | Box of LEGO bricks | A framework |
| Peripheral services (DB clients, GraphQL etc) | "Bring your own", occasionally borrowing from Squid SDK | Opinionated comprehensive support |
| Real-time data handling | Yes | Yes |
| Data transform update without resyncing | Yes | No |
| Storing aggregations without the raw data (example: keeping a total DEx volume without keeping any temporally distributed data) | Yes, with partial loss of ability to update the transform | Yes |
| Hosted service | Not yet | [Yes](https://docs.sqd.ai/cloud/) |
