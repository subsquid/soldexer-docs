This pipe is tracking swaps across the following popular exchanges:

 - Orca
 - Meteora
 - Raydium (both concentrated and constant product pools)

The swaps data is aggregated into 5m candles and some pool stats.

The pipe is a part of the [`sqd-pipes` repo](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/sqd-pipes). Here are the source code links:
 - [main function of the ingester](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/sqd-pipes/blob/main/packages/soldexer-pipes/src/indexers/swaps.ts)
