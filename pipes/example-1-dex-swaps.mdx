This pipe is tracking swaps across the following popular exchanges:

 - Orca
 - Meteora (DLMM and DAMM pools)
 - Raydium (concentrated and constant product pools)

It is a part of the [`soldexer` repo](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/soldexer). Here are some source code links:
 - [main function of the ingester](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/soldexer/blob/main/src/indexers/swaps.ts)
 - [data stream definition](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/soldexer/blob/main/src/streams/swaps/index.ts)
 - [SQL definition of the raw data table](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/soldexer/blob/main/src/db/sql/swaps.sql)

The pipe currently does no data aggregations. Take a look at the [database state definition of `simple-pipe`](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/simple-pipe/blob/master/src/transfers.sql) if you want an example of that.
