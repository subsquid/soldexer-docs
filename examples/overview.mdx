## End-to-End Pipelines

Explore these three end-to-end pipelines that demonstrate how to transform on-chain data into actionable insights.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Swaps on Solana" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/examples/example-1">
    Track swap activity across Solana DEXs—normalize token pairs and volumes,
    and write 5-minute OHLCV data directly to ClickHouse for fast, reliable
    analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metaplex NFT metadata" icon="image" href="/examples/example-2">
    Stream metadata from Metaplex mints—including names, symbols, URIs, and
    accounts—and store it in ClickHouse, ready for efficient indexing and
    lookup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="pump.fun tokens" icon="rocket" href="/examples/example-3">
    Track token launches on pump.fun in real time—capture names, symbols, and
    mints as they're created, and monitor on-chain activity from the start.
  </Card>
