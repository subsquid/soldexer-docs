Soldexer-specific Squid SDK master guide is TBA. For now, consult
 - [the common SQD SDK master guide](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/)
 - [Solana section of the SQD documentation](https://docs.sqd.ai/solana-indexing/)
 - [the `portal-api` branch of the SQD Solana template](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/solana-example/tree/portal-api) - it is modified to work with the SQD portal serving the [Soldexer API](/api-reference)
