# v3.1.2 Performance Optimization

**Release Date**: February 28, 2025

## Overview

Version 3.1.2 focuses on performance optimizations, security improvements, and additional code samples to enhance developer experience.

## Improvements

### Optimized Memory Usage for Batch Processing

We've significantly reduced memory consumption during batch processing operations, allowing for more efficient handling of large datasets:

- Reduced peak memory usage by approximately 40%
- Implemented streaming processing for large files
- Added configurable batch sizes for better resource control

### Security Updates

Several dependencies have been updated to address security vulnerabilities:

- Updated cryptographic libraries to latest versions
- Patched potential information disclosure vulnerabilities
- Enhanced input validation across all API endpoints

### New Code Samples

We've added new code samples to help developers with common integration scenarios:

- Authentication flow examples for various frameworks
- Data transformation patterns
- Webhook integration examples
- Error handling best practices

## Bug Fixes

### Race Condition in Caching Layer

Fixed a race condition that could occasionally cause stale data to be returned when multiple updates occurred simultaneously.

### Date Formatting in Exported Reports

Resolved an issue where dates in exported reports would sometimes display in inconsistent formats depending on the user's locale settings.

### Webhook Delivery Reliability

Fixed a bug that could cause webhook delivery failures under high system load conditions.

## Known Issues

- Very large datasets (>10GB) may still experience performance degradation
- Some legacy API endpoints are deprecated and will be removed in v4.0
